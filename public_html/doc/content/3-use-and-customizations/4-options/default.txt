Title: Options

Text: 

Within the Kirby configuration file `site/config/config.php` there are additional options which can be turned on if desired. Currently there is just one option.

## MathJax
If you wish to display mathematical formulae in your KDoc website, the [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) option is for you. MathJax is described as "A JavaScript display engine for mathematics that works in all browsers."

Turning on MathJax is as simple as modifying the default value of "false" to "true" in the Kirby config file mentioned earlier. The default settings are as follows.

```
c::set('kdoc.mathjax', false);
c::set('kdoc.mathjax.url', 'https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js');
c::set('kdoc.mathjax.config', 'TeX-AMS_CHTML');
```

See further information about these settings in the comments of the config file itself.An example of it's usage is, if you type:

```
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$
```

The output will look like:

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$

 Further information about how to use MathJax can be found at the [MathJax website](https://www.mathjax.org).
